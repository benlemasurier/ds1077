notes:

tie SDA/SCL to +5v via 3.9Kohm resistors to pull up the I2C bus when not in use.

tie VCC to GND via a 0.1uF and 0.01uF ceramic caps to reduce as much line noise as possible.

the slave address and the r/w bit is automatically sent by the Wire library.
  when you call Wire.beginTransmission(ADDRESS)

"acknowledgment from slave" is taken care of by the wire library.

the "command byte" is the address of the address of the desired register.
  this is sent after Wire.beginTransmission(<address>) with via Wire.send(<COMMAND BYTE>);

if multiple bytes need to be sent, just send them one after another (post acknowledgement)
  finish with Wire.endTransmission();
