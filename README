notes:

tie SDA/SCL to +5v via 3.9Kohm resistors to pull up the I2C bus when not in use.

tie VCC to GND via a 0.1uF and 0.01uF ceramic caps to reduce as much line noise as possible.

the slave address and the r/w bit is automatically sent by the Wire library.
  when you call Wire.beginTransmission(ADDRESS)

"acknowledgment from slave" is taken care of by the wire library.

the "command byte" is the address of the address of the desired register.
  this is sent after Wire.beginTransmission(<address>) with via Wire.send(<COMMAND BYTE>);

if multiple bytes need to be sent, just send them one after another (post acknowledgement)
  finish with Wire.endTransmission();


----------

OUT1 = main oscillator output - freq determined by the control register settings for the prescaler P1
        (mode bits 1M1 & 1M0) and divider N (DIV word)

OUT0 = ref output, OUT0 is taken from the output of the reference select Mux. Its freq is determined
        by the control register settings for CTRL0 and values of Prescaler P0
        (mode bits 0M1 & 0M0)

CTRL0 = multifunctional input pin that can be selected as a MUX SELECT, OUTPUT ENABLE and/or a POWERR-DOWN.
        determined by register values EN0, SEL0, and PDN0 (check table 1)

CTRL1 = mulitfunctinal input pin that can be selected as a OUTPUT ENABLE and/or a POWER-DOWN. determined by
        register PDN1 (table 2)
